      &lt;/spu&gt;
   &lt;/stream&gt;
&lt;/subpictures&gt;
</synopsis>
<para>

Each subtitle image is described by an &lt;spu&gt; tag.  The start and
optional end attributes describe when the subtitle will be displayed
on the screen, in "HR:MM:SS.HU".  The image attribute describes the
main subtitle image, which can either be a PNG or BMP file.  If your
image is not a full screen image, you can use xoffset and yoffset to
move the picture around.  In the advent that the author is unable to
use a graphics format with an alpha channel, then the transparent
attribute can be used to describe which color should become fully
transparent.  The color is in hexadecimal as "RRGGBB".  If you want to
force the display of the subtitle, regardless of whether the user has
enabled subtitles or not, you can use the force tag.  When you are
making menus, the force tag is required.

</para>
<para>

The remaining attributes and tags are related to menu creation.  The
highlight attribute shows what all the buttons look like when they are
highlighted (i.e. when you are using the arrows in the menu), and the
select attribute shows what all the buttons look like when the are
selected (i.e. for the 1-2 seconds after you press enter in the menu).
If either of these (or the image attribute) are omitted, then spumux
creates a blank (totally transparent) image.  Obviously at least one
tag should be specified.

</para>
<para>

To aid in button creation, the autooutline attribute instructs spumux
to infer where the buttons are located.  It does this by attempting to
draw rectangles around a composition of the highlight and select
images which do not intersect any opaque or semi-opaque pixels.  In
order to support textual buttons, the attribute outlinewidth allows
you to specify the width of the rectangle which is tested.  Wider
rectangles won't be able to squeeze between the letters.  Finally,
autoorder describes which way to order the automatically detected
buttons, which is important for numerically selected buttons and for
mapping buttons to button names or to the implied names.

</para>
<para>

The button and action tags describe the buttons (visibly selectable
objects on the screen) and actions (commands that are executed as soon
as the associated key is pressed on the remote).  If you are using the
autooutline feature, just designing buttons, are happy with the
inferred button navigation, and can deal with the simplistic naming
system, then you actually do not even need to specify any buttons or
actions.  Otherwise, read on.

</para>
<para>

The name attribute is used to give a button or action an easy to refer
to name.  By default they are numbered sequentially starting with "1".
The up, down, left, and right names describe which button or action
should be tied to the corresponding key when the current button is
highlighted, though if omitted spumux will use a reasonably
intelligent algorithm to determine which buttons to move to.

</para>
<para>

The (x0,y0) coordinates describe the upper left hand corner
inclusively, while the (x1,y1) coordinates describe the lower right
hand corner EXclusively.  The coordinates start at 0,0 for the upper
left hand corner.  Ideally, the y0 and y1 coordinates should both be
even, so the button edges fully empasses two interlaced scanlines,
even if there is no data in the extra scanline.  Some DVD players will
fill in the extra scanline if it is not specified; spumux makes an
effort to ensure that will be transparent but there is no guarantee.

</para>
</refsect1>
<refsect1><title>Handling text based subtitles</title>
<para>

Spumux is also able to handle text subtitles, which will be rendered to
graphics by spumux. A lot of different text (must be non-graphic) formats 
are supported (.sub, .srt, .ssa, .smi, .rt , .txt, .aqt, .jss, .js, ass).
Spumux will try to determine the format automatically. 

</para>
<para>

If processing textbased subtitles no other streams can be defined, buttons 
or others need to be processed in another pass with spumux, using another 
xml file.

</para>
<para>

Following .xml file shows the available tags and their default settings. 
Only the textsub tag is mandatory, defaults are used if the specific tag 
is not specified.

</para>
<synopsis>
&lt;subpictures&gt;
   &lt;stream&gt;
      &lt;textsub filename="demo1.srt" characterset="ISO8859-1" 
         fontsize="28.0" font="arial.ttf" horizontal-alignment="left" 
         vertical-alignment="bottom" left-margin="60" right-margin="60" 
         top-margin="20" bottom-margin="30" subtitle-fps="25" 
         movie-fps="25" movie-width="720" movie-height="574"
         force="yes"
      /&gt;
   &lt;/stream&gt;
&lt;/subpictures&gt;
</synopsis>
<para>

The textsub tag defines the settings for the text to graphics rendering. 

</para>
<para>

The filename attribute defines the path and name of the input text subtitle 
file, this is the only attribute that is mandatory.

</para>
<para>

The characterset attribute defines the characterset to be used, available 
charactersets can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv.

</para>
<para>

The fontsize attribute defines the size of the font in font units.
The font attribute defines the font used. Spumux will look into the home 
directory in subdirectory .spumux for fonts on linux systems and will 
look into the windows/fonts and subdirectory spumux of the cygwin/mingw 
home directory and into the exucution directory for windows based 
execution for the specified font. Looking for free fonts? One listing is 
here http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/links.asp?type=free&amp;part=1 
(this is only about fonts, not about operating systems).

</para>
<para>

The horizontal-alignment attribute defines the horizontal alignment of the 
subtitles. Options are: "left", "right", "center" and "default".
The "default" value causes spumux to use the attribute that is in the text 
subtitle file if the format supports such an attribute.

</para>
<para>

The vertical-alignment attribute defines the vertical alignment.
Options are: "top", "center" and "bottom".

</para>
<para>

The margin attributes define the minimum blank pixel space between the 
border of the image and the border of the subtitle lines.

</para>
<para>

Defining the subtitle-fps and movie-fps attributes make it possible for 
spumux to recalculate the subtitle timing if these are not the same.

</para>
<para>

The movie-width and movie-height attributes define the maximum size of 
the subtitle page, these shouldn't be larger than the fram-size of the 
movie frame, normally they are the same. Some DVD-players more like 
subtitle frames that are 2 or 4 pixels smaller in height.

</para>
<para>

The force option allows you to force the display of the subtitle,
regardless of whether the user has enabled subtitles or not.
